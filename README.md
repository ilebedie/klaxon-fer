# Klaxon front end (in React.js)

This is a sandbox where I can practice common tasks in React.js: 
file upload(TBA), file view on server, authentication(TBA), routing(TBA), etc.
 
Good thing about it is that it's decoupled from backend so I dont't have to use server-side web framework templates and can use multiple frontends.
